If you see this, then my blog is working :D. Sadly, there isn't much yet, but it's a start!

Even clicking more, there isn't much here unfortunately.

However, if your seeing this, that means that I finally got the CICD to work too!

Will be creating my first actual blog post soon though. As for now I think I may also add a step in my Drone pipeline that uses exiftool to remove all metadata from files in my static/img folder.
